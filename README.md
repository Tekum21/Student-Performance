# Student-Performance
## Background of Study:
Standardized testing has been a cornerstone of the educational system for a long time.Standardized testing measures a student’s progress throughout their education journey. According to Henry (2007), a standardized test is “an examination made up of uniform items which can be replicated, typically by asking short multiple choice questions which can be easily and cheaply scored by machine”.The use of standardized testing have expanded in the United States since 2002 after the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act by President George W.Bush, causing some observers to state that standardized testing is causing a “teaching to the test” mentality, which undermines America’s ability to produce innovators, imagination, and critical thinkers. Others state that these standardized exams are a fair and objective way to measure students' abilities. Besides the debate on whether standardized testing is a good indicator of student progress, there is also debate on whether certain factors; teachers role, family support, school environment, peer relationship and the most important factor is the socioeconomic status of parents have influnece on a student’s test score and general performance. School districts have tried to manipulate and change certain factors of the educational system to accommodate for these influences, with the goal of subpressing the negative impacts associated with students test scores.The poject below is design to investigate how students' performance in a standardized math, reading and writing test is affected by, their gender, parental level of education, lunch and test preparation course. It also try to investigate relationships between these variables.
